    "APIs (application programming interfaces) are hosted on web servers. When you type www.google.com in your browser's address bar, your computer is actually asking the www.google.com server for a webpage, which it then returns to your browser. APIs work much the same way, except instead of your web browser asking for a webpage, your program asks for data. This data is usually returned in JSON format. To retrieve data, we make a request to a webserver. The server then replies with our data. In R, we will use the `httr` and `jsonlite` packages to deal with this.\n",
